Yahtzee: America's Dice-Based Pastime

How to play:
Players take turns rolling five dice with the hopes of hitting favorable combos and scoring the most points. Each player has up to 3 rolls to score in a variety of ways, from 3 of a kind to a large straight. After each player has filled their sheet, the scores are tallied and the winner is decided!

Technologies used:
I used basic HTML to build the structure of the game while taking advantage of Materialize to style the game. Using mainly jQuery and vanilla javascript, I was able to enact approximately 90% of the game logic needed for the game.

Unsolved problems:
Full disclaimer, I switched projects midway through the week and was unable to put a full 10 days worth of effort into the game. I was not able to add in the left score bonus in time (if your left score is >= 63, the player receives a bonus 35 points) and I was not able to add in the Yahtzee bonus (after a player scores a Yahtzee aka 5 of a kind, any additional Yahtzee is 100 points).

Next Steps:
Other than solving the unsolved problems, I'd like to add a lot more functionality to the game as well as refactoring the dice logic. I utilized arrays but found difficulty using the array index to check scoring conditions. I'd like to add a running score board so players can check the score while playing. I'd also like to replace the opening gif with a canvas animation, as well as adding in canvas animation for the dice rolling. All in due time!
